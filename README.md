# Pass the Salt
Pass the Salt is a password manager which never stores your passwordâ€”ever. By hashing your password with the site name, Pass The Salt allows you to only ever need one password to generate all of your pseudo-random passwords for all of your services from any device.

## Technology 
Pass the Salt is built on Vue.js and Crypto.js. It will be migrated to Vue3 in the coming days, and will switch over to TypeScript in that process.
